The following is an example of how to use a webcam from a local website in KioskSimple.  You could also incorporate the logic from this example into a website running on a remote web server, but for the purpose of this example we'll store the content locally.

Copy the contents of this folder to a location on your computer.  Make sure there are no spaces in the folder path (i.e. use "WebcamExample not "Webcam Example").

Configure KioskSimple to run the local example website
---- Start the KioskSimple configuration app.
---- Select the BROWSER left menu 
---- Select the BROWSER SETTINGS
---- Under Start-up Web Page enter the file path.  If for example I copied the contents to a folder on my desktop the file path could be "file:///c:/Users/Ryan/Desktop/WebcamTest/WebcamTest.html".  You must include the prefix "file:///" for local files.


Install the Webcam Plugin and configure a webcam. 
---- After the plugin is installed, a Cameras menu items should be present on the left navigation pane. Select it. 
---- Select Webcam Plugin from the list of installed plugins. 
---- Click 'Configure at the bottom of the screen
---- Select an available installed webcams from the dropdown, optionally test the web cam on this screen
---- Select a Snapshot location folder to store snapshot images.
---- Start KioskSimple in Test Mode to test the example application.

Start KioskSimple.
